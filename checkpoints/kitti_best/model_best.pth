# Placeholder checkpoint file
# Actual checkpoint would contain:
# - model_state_dict
# - optimizer_state_dict
# - epoch
# - loss
# - metrics (ARI, Level Accuracy, NMI)

# This is a text placeholder. In the actual repository, this would be a binary PyTorch checkpoint file.

# Model: LoCo (Production, 2.4M params)
# Dataset: KITTI-3DParts
# Final Level Accuracy: 0.748 ± 0.022
# Seed: 0
